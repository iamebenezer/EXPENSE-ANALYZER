# Finance Application Improvements Summary

## âœ… Implemented Improvements

### 1. Budget Validation for Expenses
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `AddExpenseScreen.tsx` to check for active budgets before allowing expense creation
- Added budget validation logic that queries for active budgets matching the selected category and expense date
- Displays clear error message when no budget exists: "You don't have an active budget for this category. Would you like to create one first?"
- Provides direct navigation to AddBudgetScreen with "Create Budget" button

**Implementation Details:**
- Added budget query using Firestore `where` clauses for `userId`, `categoryId`, `startDate`, and `endDate`
- Uses Alert with two options: Cancel or Create Budget
- Maintains existing expense creation flow when budget exists

### 2. Dark Mode Text Color Fixes
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

**Changes Made:**
- Added missing theme colors for Switch components (`switchTrack`, `thumb`) in both light and dark themes
- Fixed hardcoded colors in various components:
  - `ThemedText.tsx`: Removed hardcoded link color
  - `AddCategoryScreen.tsx`: Added comments for intentional white text on colored backgrounds
  - `DashboardScreen.tsx`: Added comments for intentional white text on gradients and buttons
- All text elements now properly use theme-aware colors (`theme.colors.text`, `theme.colors.textLight`)

**Theme Colors Added:**
```typescript
// Light theme
switchTrack: "#E0E0E0"
thumb: "#FFFFFF"

// Dark theme  
switchTrack: "#424242"
thumb: "#E0E0E0"
```

### 3. Profile Page Cleanup
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

**Changes Made:**
- Removed entire "Legal" section containing:
  - Terms of Service link
  - Privacy Policy link
- Removed version number display ("Version 1.0.0")
- Removed unused `versionText` style
- Maintained all existing functionality:
  - User profile display
  - Edit Profile button
  - Account settings (Categories, Notifications)
  - Preferences (Dark Mode, Language, Currency)
  - Logout functionality

### 4. Enhanced Budget Notifications
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `notificationUtils.ts` with new threshold:
  - Added `BUDGET_HIGH_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 90` (90% of budget used)
  - Enhanced `checkBudgetStatus` to return new status: `'high-warning'`
  - Updated notification generation to include high-warning status

**Notification Levels:**
- **80%**: Warning (orange) - "You're approaching your budget limit"
- **90%**: High Warning (darker orange) - "Your budget is running low"  
- **95%**: Danger (red) - "Your budget is almost depleted"
- **100%+**: Exceeded (dark red) - "Your budget has been exceeded"

**UI Updates:**
- Updated `NotificationsScreen.tsx` to handle new status types
- Added new icon and color for `high-warning` status
- Updated `BudgetScreen.tsx` to display new status colors
- All notifications appear in the existing NotificationsScreen

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Budget Validation Testing
- [ ] Try adding expense without any budget for the category
- [ ] Verify error message appears with "Create Budget" option
- [ ] Test navigation to AddBudgetScreen from error dialog
- [ ] Confirm expense creation works normally when budget exists
- [ ] Test with different date ranges (expense outside budget period)

### Dark Mode Testing
- [ ] Toggle between light and dark modes
- [ ] Verify all text is readable in both modes

- [ ] Verify 80% warning appears (orange)
- [ ] Verify 90% high-warning appears (darker orange)
- [ ] Verify 95% danger appears (red)
- [ ] Verify 100%+ exceeded appears (dark red)
- [ ] Check notifications display in NotificationsScreen
- [ ] Test notification refresh and real-time updates
