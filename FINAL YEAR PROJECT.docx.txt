LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF EXPENSE TRACKING 
The practice of tracking expenses has been a crucial aspect of financial management for centuries. Early civilizations relied on primitive methods such as tally sticks, clay tablets, and handwritten ledgers to record financial transactions. These rudimentary accounting systems helped individuals and businesses monitor their income and expenditures, laying the foundation for modern financial tracking systems (Smith, 1998).
The first known method of expense tracking dates back to the Mesopotamian civilization around 3000 BCE, where merchants and traders used cuneiform tablets to record financial transactions. These early records indicate an effort to manage trade, debts, and payments systematically (Klein & Moore, 2001). Similarly, ancient Egyptian accountants used papyrus scrolls to document financial exchanges, reflecting the growing need for organized financial record-keeping (Johnson, 2005).
During the medieval period, bookkeeping practices evolved significantly. The introduction of the double-entry bookkeeping system in 1494 by Luca Pacioli revolutionized financial record-keeping. Pacioli's system provided a structured approach to tracking financial transactions, ensuring greater accuracy and transparency in expense management. This method is still used in modern accounting practices, serving as the basis for personal and corporate financial management (Pacioli, 1494).
The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries further transformed expense tracking. With the expansion of businesses and trade, financial management became more complex, necessitating more systematic record-keeping methods. Companies began employing professional accountants to manage their books, while individuals started maintaining personal ledgers to track household expenses. The widespread use of paper-based accounting systems allowed for more detailed and structured financial records (Williams, 1872).
The advent of computers in the mid-20th century brought significant advancements in financial management. The introduction of spreadsheet software, such as VisiCalc in 1979 and Microsoft Excel in 1985, enabled individuals and businesses to automate financial calculations and record-keeping. These digital tools provided users with a more efficient and accurate way to track expenses, reducing the reliance on manual calculations (Power, 2004).
With the rise of the internet and mobile technology in the 21st century, expense tracking has become even more sophisticated. The emergence of financial applications, such as Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), and PocketGuard, has allowed users to track expenses in real time, categorize spending, and set financial goals. These applications integrate with bank accounts and credit cards, providing automated expense tracking and analysis (Deloitte, 2019).
The future of expense tracking is expected to involve further automation through artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI-powered financial management tools can predict spending patterns, offer budget recommendations, and provide personalized financial insights. As technology continues to evolve, expense tracking will become increasingly seamless, enhancing financial literacy and personal financial management (McKinsey, 2022).
